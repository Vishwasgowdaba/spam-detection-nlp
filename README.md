## 🚀 Project Overview
A production-grade spam classifier achieving **98.5% accuracy**, demonstrating:
- End-to-end ML pipeline development
- NLP preprocessing techniques
- Model optimization skills
- Clean, maintainable code practices

## 🛠 Technical Implementation
### Core Stack
- **Python 3.9** with OOP principles
- **Scikit-Learn** (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing
- **TF-IDF** vectorization
- **Flask** REST API (optional deployment)

### Key Features
✔ Custom text preprocessing pipeline  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
✔ Class imbalance handling (SMOTE)  
✔ Unit tests with pytest  

## 📈 Performance Metrics
| Metric | Naive Bayes | Logistic Regression |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Accuracy | 98.2% | **98.5%** |
| Precision | 0.96 | 0.97 |
| Recall | 0.94 | 0.95 |
| F1-Score | 0.95 | 0.96 |
